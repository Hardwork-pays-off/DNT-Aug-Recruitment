I took a sample video and stored it in the file "SampleVideo.mp4".

I have produced its reversed and slow motion version using OpenCV in Python and stored it in the file "Output_Video.mp4".

The code for reversing is stored in the file "Reverse_code.py".

The code for slowing down the video is in the file "Slow_code.py".
